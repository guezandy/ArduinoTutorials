ArduinoTutorials
================


This was an initiative I founded and funded through the help of IEEE and UM Electrical Department.

I taught weekly lesson on how to prgram (C++) and Arduino Microcontroller. 

Lessons cover from the simple blinking an LED from things as complex as running a GPS shield, or a RFID tag reader.

Class my code is here
